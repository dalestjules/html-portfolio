<H2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</H2>
<hr>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</h3>
<p>To be honest, any of the Harry Potter Films could take this spot. <br>It Just depends on my mood.</p>

<h3>James Bond - Casino Royale</h3>
<p>I believe Daniel Craig played the best Bond. <br>We can agree to disagree</p>

<h3>Topgun Maverick</h3>
<p>This film was one of those which had me at the tip of my sit from start till end.
